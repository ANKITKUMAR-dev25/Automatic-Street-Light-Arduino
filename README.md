# Automatic Street Light System using Arduino

This project is an energy-efficient **Automatic Street Light System** built using **Arduino Uno** and **LDR sensors**. The system automatically turns street lights on during darkness and off during daylight using ambient light detection.

---

## üîß Features

- Automatically controls street lights based on surrounding light intensity.
- Reduces energy consumption and improves efficiency.
- Simple and cost-effective circuit using basic components.

---

## üí° How It Works

The system uses an **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** to detect ambient light levels. When the environment becomes dark (e.g., evening or night), the resistance of the LDR increases, and the Arduino triggers the **relay module** to switch ON the street light. When sufficient light is detected (e.g., daytime), the relay turns OFF the street light.

## üõ†Ô∏è Circuit Connections

| Component      | Arduino Pin     |
|----------------|------------------|
| LDR (via voltage divider) | A0 (Analog Input) |
| Relay IN Pin   | Digital Pin 8    |
| VCC & GND      | 5V and GND       |

- Connect the LDR in a voltage divider configuration with a resistor (~10kŒ©).
- Connect the output of the divider to Arduino A0.
- Relay module‚Äôs IN pin connects to Digital Pin 8.
